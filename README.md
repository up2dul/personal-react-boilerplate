# Personal React Boilerplate
This is my very simple personal boilerplate for building application using React.js + Vite + Typescript.

This boilerplate consists of the following:
1. Vite module bundler
2. React.js v.18
3. Typescript
4. Eslint with some additional rules
5. Prettier
6. Absolute import and path aliases. `@` as `/src` path directory
7. Husky + Lint staged
